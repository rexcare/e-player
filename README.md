# Video player

This is a quick personal electron app I created to be able to quickly watch a series of video files. It allows you to specify a folder which contains videos files or a folder structure that contains video files, and it will create a playlist from those videos. The video next video will autoplay when one finishes and the interface will allow you to control the playback speed. 

This project has been duck-taped together in an evening and has only been tested on my macOS computer, so use very carefully. I am open to contributions if you want to make this thing better.
